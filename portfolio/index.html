											<div class="concept">
											<p>The project aimed to <strong> repurpose a coaster</strong>. Not only does it protect the table from moisture, it is also interactive in order to <strong> create an efficient service</strong>. </p>
											<p>The interactive coaster <strong>weighs the amount of liquid</strong> in the glass and sends data to a tablet interface through <strong>WiFi</strong> using an <strong> Arduino microcontroller</strong>. </p> 
											<p>The amount of liquid was indicated using a <strong>neopixel ring</strong>. A green light for full glass, a red light for an almost empty glass, a yellow light when there is no glass on the coaster, and a purple ‘slowly circulating’ light to indicate help. </p>
											<p>All these states are <strong>visualized on a GUI</strong> where the bartender/working staff can see where glasses are empty/full and who needs help or service. </p>
											</div>
											<h3> Ideation</h3>
											<p>Based on a state of analysis to find different use cases of when a coaster is used, we started of by some initial low-fidelity sketches to represent the concepts.</p>

											<h3> Body storming </h3>
											<p>Everything looked feasible and easy in our sketches, but those same brilliant ideas might not be at all helpful when you add the human factor.

											Body storming is a creativity technique that we used help us visualize how the ideas would work in a real life setting. After that we realised that we needed to change some of our ideas. </p>
											<img src="img/body.jpg"></img>

											<h3> Story board </h3>
											<p>We used <a href="www.storyboardthat.com"> storyboardthat </a> to visually depict scenarios with storyboard. This complemented the earlier sketches in terms of broadening the finer details of the interaction per se,the materials and the over all "feeling" involved.</p>
											<img src="img/storyboard.png"></img>

											<h3> Final design </h3> 
											<p>The final prototype came out using Illustrator to design our desired outcome and print the designs using a 3D printer. After hours of putting everything into the coaster, soldering the pieces and calibration, we finally had our smart coaster ready. </p>
											<img src="img/3dprinting.png"></img>

											
											<p> A short movie will be uploaded soon. </p>

											<h3> Instructable </h3>
											<p>We have published an <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Smart-Coaster/">instructable </a> with detail further details of the coaster and the code. Within a week we got over 50 favorites and over 2000 views. </p>

											Pollensor helps pollen allergy sufferers with a simple pollen detection interface. The user can see pollen levels on a map. This is made possible by a large number of pollen detectors placed at various locations throughout Stockholm. The app also has helpful features such as location search and route optimization.</strong></p>

												<p><i> How can we design attractive new solutions for the Internet of Things that are meaningful for people in their everyday lives? </i></p>
												<p > <strong>The idea was born</strong> during Spring, when the pollen season had just started. Me myself, my family and some friends of mine are all pollen sufferers. So I started out doing background research about the current state of art and existing concepts in the domain.</p>

										<p> Today there are apps in both Apple store and Google play, all very similar to each other except the layouts. </p>
										<p>The <strong>difference with my app </strong> is that I am  using pollen sensors that will give real-time analysis about the amount of pollen particles in the air using advanced sensors. </p>
										<p>Compared to commercial sensors that are available today, this pollen sensor will be more useful especially since it can <strong>detect all sorts of pollen.</strong> </p>

											<p> There are ongoing research about creating pollen sensor to hang on lampposts around areas in cities. The most recent research is a project called <a href="http://phys.org/news/2016-03-big-aims-easier.html">
												<strong>GASP (Geolocated Allergen Sensing Platform)</strong></a>. 
											</p>

											<p>The application I have designed is aimed to work together with sensors that use lasers to “count” airborne particulates and determine their size as they cross the laser light’s path.</p> 
											<p>As GASP is still ongoing research, <strong>my hope is to do a collaboration with GASP and my suggested interactive prototype.</strong></p>

												<p> Having only 6 weeks part-time to complete the project, our first priority was to <strong>aggressively narrow the scope of our app </strong>. By the numbers of features in control, we would have the time to work on multiple iterations. </p> <p> In this project, the importance lied in having an interaction on the model data including the possibility to change the data (not only displaying it).</p>

													<p> To get both conceptual and usability feedback, we tested using a mix of paper and <strong>InVision prototypes</strong>. Testing it with project members from Studieresan, we tried several concepts, with the most interesting ones presented in the final version. We decided to create the application using <strong> the front-end framework Ionic</strong>.</p>

												<p><strong>Challenges</strong> is aimed to give motivation for the users to do fun challenges during the trip. The user can easliy choose a challenge, upload a picture, add description and tag the other users who contributed. </p>

												<p> Our application has a high usability and a good architecture, hence the highest grade was given. </p>

							<h2> Thoughtful design</h2>
							<p>I have a <strong style="color:#ffb347;">passion </strong> to create experiences through thoughtful design. I believe that a thoughtful design is where <strong style="color:#ffb347;">the user's emotional state in mind </strong> has been kept throughout the enitre design process.
